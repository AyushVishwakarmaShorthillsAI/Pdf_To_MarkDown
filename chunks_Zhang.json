      "text": "Background The PACS gene family has been demonstrated to be related to intracellular vesicular trafficking. The phenotypic manifestations caused by the pathogenic variants of PACS include epilepsy, intellectual disability/developmental delay, and malformations, such as facial abnormalities. Methods We identified seven new cases with pathogenic or likely pathogenic PACS variants using next-generation sequencing. Detailed information obtained from these patients was analyzed along with that obtained from previously reported patients. Results With the inclusion of the newly diagnosed cases in this study, 103 cases with PACS gene family-related neurological diseases were reported, of which 43 were PACS2 -related cases and the remaining were PACS1 -related cases. Most patients had seizures, which have been reported to be effectively controlled by several types of anti-seizure medications (ASMs).",

Almost all patients had intellectual disability/developmental delay. The most common pathogenic missense variants were PACS1 p. Arg203Trp and PACS2 p.Glu209Lys. In addition, we report a patient carrying a likely pathogenic copy number variation (CNV) (de novo heterozygous deletion of chr14:105821380-106107443, 286 kilobase, destroyed part of the furin-binding region domain and the protein structure after it) with more severe and refractory late-onset epilepsy. Conclusions The clinical phenotypes of the different PACS heterozygous missense variants were similar. The pathogenic variant sites of PACS1 and PACS2 were quite limited but located in different regions. A CNV destroying part of the PACS2 gene might also be pathogenic.",

Thus, the clinical phenotypes resulting from the pathogenic variants of PACS1 and PACS2 were similar, but the pathomechanism remains to be elucidated. In this study, we reported six cases of PACS -related neurological disorders, including five cases of PACS2 -related neurological disorder and one case of PACS1 -related neurological disorder. In addition, we report that a CNV (copy number variation) (heterozygous deletion of chr14:105821380-106107443, 286 kilobase) might cause a PACS2 -related disorder. We also collated, summarized, and analyzed all reported cases of PACS gene family-related neurological diseases and our newly diagnosed cases to elucidate the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of PACS -related neurological disease.",

      "text": "PACS1 and PACS2 are highly homologous [1], and both are derived from the prevertebrate PACS gene. Both genes have been implicated in intracellular vesicular trafficking [20]. PACS1 localizes cargo to the trans-Golgi network, whereas PACS2 is involved in vesicular transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER to the Golgi, cell membranes, mitochondria, and other pathways. Currently, PACS2 is also considered to be related to apoptosis, autophagy and other pathways [1-3]. PACS1 and PACS2 (also called PACS-1 and PACS-2) both contain three regions [20], viz. the FBR, MR, and C-terminal region (CTR). The 1 3 FBR, which is the functional domain, possesses the highest degree of homology and is involved in recognition and binding between the proteins and the cargo. The MR contains nuclear localization signals and phosphorylation sites, which play a regulatory role in the function of the PACS, while the specific function of CTR remains unclear.",

Arg203 is located in the FBR, and the missense variation in this amino acid may have affected recognition or binding between the PACS1 protein and the cargo. Both variants affected the same CpG dinucleotide. Studies in zebrafish have suggested a dominant-negative or gain-of-function patho-mechanism in PACS1 -related neurological disorders [15, 21]. The two pathogenic point variants in PACS2 were one amino acid apart; both involved switching of glutamate to lysine, resulting in remarkably similar clinical phenotypes, suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism. Both variants were located in the MR, i.e., the regulatory domain, with Glu209 being the last amino acid in the auto-regulatory region. The presence of two indels in this region suggests that the structure near this site may be highly relevant for the regulatory function of PACS2. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the PACS2 p.",
