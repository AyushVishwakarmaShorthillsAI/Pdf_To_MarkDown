Facial dysmorphism and other organs' involvement were also frequently reported. Brain MRIs evidenced anomalies of the posterior cerebellar fossa, foliar distortion of the cerebellum, vermis hypoplasia, white matter reduction, and lateral ventricles enlargement. Genetic testing is more frequent in children. Only 4 cases have been reported in adults to date. Conclusions: It is important to maintain a high suspicion of new pathogenic gene variants in adult patients presenting with a characteristic clinical picture correlated with radiologic changes.",

Many patients present with cognitive deficits resulting from genetic defects and neurobiological changes and processes associated with the disease that alter normal childhood development [4-6].

The etiology of DEEs is varied, involving both hereditary and genetic causes, as well as acquired causes such as metabolic abnormalities or brain injuries [7]. One characteristic of DEEs related to gene variants is the early onset of symptoms, beginning in the first days or weeks of life [4]. The term 'DEE' is used when both epileptic activity and development disorders impact an individual's behavior and cognitive status [5]. DEEs are defined especially by the pediatricians with the description of characteristic phenotype in children.",

The epileptiform activity can vary depending on the age and stage of brain maturity, with phenotypic changes as age advances. The frequent seizures and epileptic electrical discharges may worsen the evolution of a DEE and are also responsible for behavioral, cognitive, and motor regression, with progressive neurological damage contributing to the aggravating psychomotor dysfunction [5,8]. Two PACS genes have been described in vertebrates: PACS1 and PACS2 [9]. The genes have different functions but similar structures [10].",

The PACS1 gene, located on chromosome 11.q13.1-q13.2, consists of 24 exons. The PACS2 gene, located on chromosome 14q32.33, consists of 26 exons. Both PACS1 and PACS2 mutations have been reported to be associated with neurological disorders: early onset epilepsy, intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and different malformations [12,13]. The PACS2 gene encodes the protein Q86VP3, which consists of 889 amino acids. PACS2 is a multifunctional protein with nuclear gene expression, is well-expressed in the brain, is involved in communication between the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and mitochondria [1,9,14], and may be involved in ion channel trafficking [10].

The first cases of the recurrent c.625G]A (p.Glu209Lys) pathogenic variant of the PACS2 gene with DEE 66 were reported in 2018 [7]. PACS2 gene mutation is associated with intellectual development disorders, autism, early onset (predominantly neonatal), epilepsy, cerebellar damage, occasional facial dysmorphisms, hematological disorders, and, in rare cases, distal limb abnormalities [2,3,14]. The understanding of the molecular substrates driving the pathophysiology of neurological diseases that involve intellectual disability, neurodevelopmental disorders, and epileptic seizures has been greatly enhanced following the advent of whole exome sequencing and further advances in genome analysis [1]. There is a growing need for patients to receive an etiological diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to provide updated infor- mation to help with an accurate prognosis, appropriate treatment recommendations, and suitable genetic advice.",

Our analysis focused on neurological and psychiatric clinical manifestations, the presence of other symptoms or malformations in other organs, paraclinical examinations performed, and management strategies and treatments used. We also assessed the progression of the disorder and the clinical outcomes associated with therapeutic interventions. Inclusion criteria: We applied several inclusion criteria to select studies. We only included English language in extenso articles or those with institutional access that presented case reports, case series, or reviews involving patients diagnosed with DEE66 who had undergone genetic testing to confirm the presence of the PACS2 p.Glu209Lys mutation. We only included articles that contained relevant data. The articles and titles were evaluated by two independent experts (AS and MS), with their results compared to reach a consensus.",

All identified articles were analyzed and screened. The evaluated articles were published between 15 October 1999 and 6 December 2023. In total, 364 articles were identified using the search criteria. Following duplicate removal (n = 66), 298 records were screened and analyzed. Following this, 114 articles were excluded due to not containing relevant data. The remaining 184 articles were further assessed for eligibility. One hundred and sixty-nine either did not fulfill the inclusion criteria or did not allow full access, while four articles were published in languages other than English. Therefore, 11 publications were selected for inclusion. From these publications, 29 patients were identified and included in the review.",

Considering the cognitive and motor developmental delay demonstrated by the patient, the Invitae Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) panel was additionally requested. The raw reads were aligned to the genome reference GRCh37 (Consortium Human Build 37), which is known as human genome assembly 19 (hg19). The patient was found to be heterozygous for the pathogenic variant c.625G]A (p.Glu209Lys or E209K) in the PACS2 gene. Heterozygous PACS2 gene mutations are reported to result in DEE66 (MIM #618067) [7].

According to ClinVar, it is pathogenic/likely pathogenic [25], while based on VarSome, it is pathogenic [26]. <!-- image --] We used the MutPred2 software to predict the pathogenicity of the PACS2 E209K substitution by integrating molecular and genetic data [27]. The software predicted a gain of SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, and methylation at E209 and a gain of loop and phosphorylation at S213, with a MutPred2 score of 0.534 and p ≤ 0.05. We used the variant effect predictor (VEP) from Ensembl to investigate the effect of the identified variant on the PACS2 gene, Q86VP3 protein sequence, transcripts, and regulatory regions identified in our patient [28].

Some patients presented with a wide-based gait [7,22]. This was also noted in our patient. Ocular abnormalities and the presence of nystagmus were also described [7,22]. This neurological sign was also present in our patient. Autism spectrum disorders and intellectual deficits with learning disabilities are characteristic of PACS2 -related DEE and were reported by many authors, including us.",

Brain imaging highlighted frequent anomalies of the posterior cerebral fossa with cerebellar dysplasia, cerebellar gyri irregularities, foliar distortion of the cerebellum, mega cisterna magna, cerebral atrophy, and vermis hypoplasia [7,22]. Some of these were present in our case. The vermis receives sensitive afferents from the lower limbs, trunk, upper limbs, cephalic extremity, and the vestibular and auditory apparatus and in turn sends efferent fibers to the cortex and brainstem [31]. Vermis atrophy and ataxic gait have been described in chronic alcohol users [32]. In our patient, rapidly progressing severe cerebral atrophy was evident at a young age. The brain CT scan performed in 2009 revealed generalized white matter disorder with diffuse hypodensities, ventriculomegaly, and the presence of cavum septi pellucidi.",

Unlike the majority of these cases, our patient also had a later onset, with seizures beginning approximately 4.5 months after birth. Recent studies support the role of some DEE genes in neurodegeneration [37,38], and the evolution in adult patients with the PACS2 p.Glu209Lys pathogenic variant suggests that this gene is also involved in neuronal loss and early neurodegeneration. The first reported case with cortical anomalies (polymicrogyria and pachygyria) belongs to Checri R et al. [23]. White matter reduction in the parietal region was described by Dentici et al. [1]. Brain atrophy at young ages and a decrease in posterior periventricular white matter volume can be observed in the images published by Mizuno T et al. [18].

For this reason, information on the long-term evolution of these cases until adulthood is almost absent in the medical literature. In this review, we identified only three cases reported in adults, one with a very brief description, to which the case from own clinical experience is added [16,17,19]. Sakaguchi Y et al. described a 23-year-old man with initial motor development delay and progressive atrophy of the cerebellum [16]. Valenzuela et al. described a 25-year-old male with lateral occipital horns ventricular enlargement, which was interpreted as secondary to an obstruction produced by a vascular malformation [17].",

PACS2 has three important regions: The N-terminal furin binding region (FBR) can recognize and bind with various cargo proteins. It plays a role in intracellular protein trafficking by recognizing acidic amino acid residues on cargo proteins [60]. The PACS2 p.Glu209Lys mutation leads to reduction/loss-of-function-like of PACS2 and alters the capacity of this region to form reversible bindings, disturbing cellular homeostasis [13]. The middle region (MR) contains phosphorylation sites and plays a major regulatory role. It promotes interactions between proteins and regulates PACS2 functions during cellular growth, repair, and death [46].",

The C-terminal region (CTR): the specific function of CTR remains unclear [13,46]. Some cargo proteins that bind with PACS2 might induce the activation and recruitment of lysosomes, contributing to apoptosis [62]. Therefore, through its involvement in membrane trafficking, PACS2 plays an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through its proapoptotic and antiapoptotic effects [43]. The mutation of the PACS2 gene results in alterations in the capacity of the autoregulatory domain to modulate this interaction, as well as interactions between PACS2 and other proteins that participate in normal neuronal function and brain development [1,7].",

In rodent experiments, the noradrenergic cell group A7 demonstrated that PACS-2 depletion in these cells prevents apoptosis by preventing cytochrome C release in the cytoplasm. Cytochrome C leads to the release of Ca 2+ from the ER and activates executioner caspases [9]. Additionally, the selective apoptosis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells induced by TNFα requires PACS-2 [8,59]. Some molecules, such as the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, which is found in hepatobiliary cancer cells, promote PACS2 degradation, resulting in apoptosis inhibition [63]. However, in cases of DNA damage, PACS2 phosphorylation plays a cytoprotective role, highlighting its antiapoptotic role [43,59,64].",

The PACS2 p.Glu209Lys mutation [14] affects the capacity of the PACS2 FBR to bind cargo proteins [7], resulting in altered control over the interaction between cargo binding regions and proteins, causing alterations in cellular functions [7,11]. The c.625G]A missense mutation (referred to as E209K) occurs in the MR of PACS2 and modifies the biochemical characteristics of this region. The p.Glu209Lys mutation alters the regulatory domain, reflected by difficulties in PACS2 binding cargo proteins, which negatively impacts neuronal migration, neurogenesis, interneural communication, cerebellum development, and dendritic arborization [65,66]. It is thought that mutations in this gene could cause ion channel dysfunctions, resulting in a phenotype that is similar to channelopathies that cause epileptic seizures.",

The long-term evolution of our case, characterized by marked cerebellar and supratentorial progressive atrophy, suggests that proapoptotic signals also act later in the disease evolution, during the intrauterine life of the fetus, after birth, and during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The oldest patients with the PACS2 p.Glu209Lys pathogenic variant were described in the third and fourth decades of life.

Sometimes, this may be challenging, but the correct identification of the diagnosis can increase the chances of adequate treatment. Gradually, genetic testing in adults must become a scenario with which adult neurologists should become familiar. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiological changes underlying gene defects will be helpful to pave the way toward future personalized treatments. Further research (which should include a larger cohort of patients of different ages) is needed for a better understanding of the disease and to widen the pool of knowledge.
